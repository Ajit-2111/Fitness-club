## API Integration

This app uses the [ExerciseDB API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb) from RapidAPI to fetch exercise data such as:
- Exercise names
- Body parts involved
- Equipment required
- Detailed instructions for performing each exercise

## Environment Variables

The API key for ExerciseDB is stored securely in the `.env` file. Make sure to:
- Add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

Example `.env` setup:
```env
REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
```
